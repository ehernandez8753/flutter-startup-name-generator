# startup_namer

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a deeper study of Flutter. This app randomly generates startup company names by accessing the english_words external library found on pub.dev. It also allows a user to select their favorite suggestions, which then are visible in a separate route.
